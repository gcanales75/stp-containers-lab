1. Change directory (cd) to the Docker project working directory

	```sh
	cd stpEksLabRepo/website/
	```

1. This folder contains the website and Dockerfile source code we will use to deploy a containarized application in our EKS cluster.

	```
	cat Dockerfile
	```

1. Run this command to create the Docker image

	```
	docker build -t stp/website .
	```

1. Run the container locally

	```
	docker run -P -d -p 8080:80 stp/website
	```

	```
	docker container ps
	```
