A task is a collection of one or more containers that is the smallest deployable unit of your application. A task definition is a JSON document that serves as the blueprint for ECS to know how to deploy and run your tasks.
The console makes it easier to create this definition by exposing all the parameters graphically. In addition, the console creates two dependencies:

- The Amazon CloudWatch log group to store the aggregated logs from the task
- The task execution IAM role that gives Fargate the permissions to run the task

1. In the left navigation pane, choose **Task Definitions**, then click on **Create new task definition**.
