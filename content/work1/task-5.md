+++

A service in ECS using Fargate serves a similar purpose to an Auto Scaling group in EC2. It ensures that the needed number of tasks are running both for scaling as well as spreading the tasks over multiple Availability Zones for high availability. A service creates and destroys tasks as part of its role and can optionally add or remove them from an Application Load Balancer as targets as it does so.

1. Open the ECS console. Service *search box* > ECS

1. In the left navigation pane, choose **Task Definitions**.

1. Mark the check box next to the Task definition you created in *Task 3*, click on **Actions**, and then click on **Create Service**.

	In the Service page you could find details about the associated load balancer, tasks, events, metrics, and logs:
 
	Scale the service from one task to multiple tasks:

1. Click on **Update**.
